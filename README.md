# mux_81_RTL

This repository contains Verilog implementation for the construction of an **8:1 multiplexer** using **4:1 multiplexers** and a **2:1 multiplexer**. The design is modular, promoting reusability and clarity.
<br/> To implement an 8:1 multiplexer using 4:1 multiplexers in Verilog, we can use a hierarchical approach. 
<br/> Break down the problem into smaller parts and instantiate multiple 4:1 multiplexers to construct the 8:1 multiplexer.
<br/> *Design Language: **Verilog***
<br/> *Design Tool: **Xilinx Vivado***
